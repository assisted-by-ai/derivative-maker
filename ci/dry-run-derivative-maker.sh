## Drive the dry-run smoke build for .github/workflows/dry-run.yml.
##
## help-steps/run-as-user creates a 'builder' user with passwordless
## sudo, chowns the source tree, and execs the given command as that
## user. This satisfies sanity-tests' "source must not be owned by
## root" check while still letting the build steps that need sudo
## (cowbuilder, mkdir under /var/cache/pbuilder) work.
##
## --unsupported-os true: ubuntu-latest's 'debian:trixie' container
## *should* identify as trixie and pass the OS sanity check, but
## the flag protects the workflow from an unexpected codename detected
## by a build step computing it from apt sources.
##
## A plain 'timeout' wraps the call to ensure this doesn't hang. The
## workflow timeout should also prevent this.
##
## Standalone-runnable: from a checked-out source tree with
## /usr/libexec/helper-scripts symlinked and the apt deps installed
## (see ci/dry-run-install.sh), 'bash ci/dry-run-derivative-maker.sh'
## reproduces what CI does.
